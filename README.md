# Steamworks-2017 Rasberry Pi Files

The Backup Camera Code for the Rasperry Pi. Should not be much else.

THIS BRANCH SHOULD NEVER BE MERGED WITH THE MASTER BRANCH. EVER.

[UPDATE]

YAY, IT NOW WORKS. Brogan is still working on a potential vlcj implementation instead, but this will work for now.

### Goals
 - [X] Add Overlays
 - [X] Invert Camera
 - [X] Implement FLASK
 - [X] Use FLASK to stream and create user interface (Does it work?)

### How to run

Run the app.py file, and make sure everything in this branch is in the same folder.
